        <h1>Marquana Burgess</h1>
        <h2>Photographer, Illustrator, Designer, and Musician</h2>
        <p>As a photographer I am drawn to places and events that would look great in a photo. From 2017 to 2019 I mainly did concert and event 
          photography, before the pandemic stopped them from happening. I also did a few portraits for homecoming and I had the change to take 
          Christmas family portraits for my friend in 2018. I am drawn to neon lights and dark shadows, places like arcades and concert venues, 
          so I try to make sure I depict those well in my work.</p>
        <p>I am also a musician. I play bass and sing in a band called Til We Ignite. In this band, I am also in charge of designing merch,
        which is where the illustration and designer part come in. I am currently taking classes to become well versed in graphic design, but
        through concert photography and networking with other artists, I became interested in design back in 2017. </p>
